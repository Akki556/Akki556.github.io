      <p>I am AKHIL KRISHNA TELAPROLU, first year graduate student in the Department of Computer Science.
       My Banner ID is 00436510. My under graduation was in Computer Science and Engineering back in India in 2020 with a GPA of 3.10. 
       After graduating, I received a job offer though campus placements and served there for a year.
       Later, I realized the importance of understanding certain key elements to be able to survive in the computer science industry and decided to pursue higher education by entering a masterâ€™s program at BSU for Fall 2021. 
       Coming to the United States and surviving here feels challenging and adventurous day by day.
       Throughout my life in India, I was able to grasp things around me rather quickly and apply them in the daily tasks which created a passion to dig deep into the web development aspects and stand myself as an efficient programmer. 
       Since the United States educational system is widely known for its dynamic nature, I studied the colleges which meets my requirements.
       I heard about BSU through a friend who recommended to study here and i approached the academic advisor and was really impressed by the way they made me feel about the student culture and benefits through their program. 
       And that's how I chose to join BSU for higher education.
       I am right now in my second semester, and I can't even express how many moments I got to experience in the past few months.
       Especially during this pandemic, I am grateful for the college caring about so many international students like me to make them feel like home.
       Last semester was so enjoyable yet continuously learning the field specific techniques gave me the satisfaction that I chose a right path being here. As a result, I also received a GPA of 3.9 in the first semester and made so many friends.
